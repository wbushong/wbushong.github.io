								<h1><strong>Teaching</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>
								I love teaching both graduates and undergraduates and jump at any opportunity to teach that arises. When I was an undergraduate at UC San Diego, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/">Roger Levy's</a> psycholinguistics class had a tremendous impact on me -- if it weren't for his awesome teaching that got me so excited to learn more, I probably wouldn't  be where I am today! Since then it's been my goal to set off that same spark of joy and excitement in as many students as I can. Below you'll find a list of my various teaching experiences and awards over the years.
							</p>
							<h3>Teaching-As-Research Fellowship (2019)</h3>
							<p>
								For the year of 2019 I am a Teaching-As-Research (TAR) fellow funded by the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL), an international consortium aimed at improving teaching through research. I'm  fascinated by the relationships between critical thinking, metacognition, and concept acquisition, so in the fall I'll be conducting a research project aimed at improving critical thinking skills in the classroom. Along with two awesome undergrads interested in teaching, we'll lead several workshops for students in BCS 152 centered around metacognitive activities to improve critical thinking. It's my hope that -- if these workshops are successful -- instructors will introduce these techniques into their lectures.
							</p>
							<h3>Instructor, CSP 502: Cognitive Foundations of Behavior (Summer 2019)</h3>
							<p>
								This is a whirlwind of a bootcamp course for clinical psychology PhD students at University of Rochester. Over the course of six sessions we'll cover a broad range of topics in the cognitive sciences. I'm looking forward to working with graduate students again!
							</p>
							<h3>Co-Instructor, BCS 152: Language and Psycholinguistics (Fall 2018)</h3>
							<p>This introductory psycholinguistics class for cognitive science undergraduates is my absolute favorite class to teach. After being a TA the previous year, I got the opportunity to co-teach it in 2018 with <a href="https://sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/yang_chung-lin_martin/index.html">Martin Yang</a>. I gave eight of the lectures, covering topics like perceptual adaptation, syntax, and pragmatics, as well as contributing to assignment and exam design.
							</p>
							<h3>Edward Peck Curtis Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching (2018)</h3>
							<p>
								I was honored to receive U of R's graduate teaching award for my work in BCS 152 the previous semester. My favorite comment from a student who submitted a nomination letter is too personal to share in a public forum, so I'll leave my second favorite here: "Wednesday should teach all the BCS classes." :)
							</p>
							<h3>Teaching Assistant, BCS 152: Language and Psycholinguistics (Fall 2017)</h3>
							<p>
								This TA-ship was very unique in that in the very beginning of the semester, we had to swap in <a href="https://sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/tanenhaus_michael/index.html">Mike Tanenhaus</a> for the original instructor. Mike pulled off the unexpected teaching burden beautifully, but of course the other TAs and I had to pick up some extra weight. This turned out to be something of a blessing in disguise: I got to give a guest lecture, design exam questions, and spend a lot of time with students one-on-one. 
							</p>
							<h3>Teaching Assistant, CSP 519: General Linear Models II (Spring 2017)</h3>
							<p>
								TAing this course was my first experience teaching graduate students. Many first-year students in the clinical psychology, social psychology, and cognitive science PhD programs at U of R take this course to fulfill a statistics requirement. We mostly cover linear regression and have labs using either SPSS or R. Being an avid R user myself, I of course jumped at the chance to TA the R labs and spread the excitement! I taught weekly hands-on labs, designed homework assignments, and graded code for exams.
							</p>
							<h3>Teaching Assistant, BCS 111: Foundations of Cognitive Science (Fall 2016)</h3>
							<p>
								This was my first TAship of graduate school and a good way to ease into teaching since I had very few responsibilities apart from grading and leading exam review sessions. The best part of being a TA for this course was watching the awesome Dave Ruskin teach -- if my lectures are ever half as interesting and engaging as his, I would be very happy!
							</p>
							<h3>Teaching Assistant, COGS 14A: Experimental Design (Fall 2013)</h3>
							<p>
								This was my very first time teaching as an undergraduate at UC San Diego. I led weekly discussion sections, so it was very intense prep for someone with zero prior experience! Luckily I think I managed fairly well, and I developed two of the strategies I still use in my teaching to this day: coming up with analogies for concepts on-the-fly to meet students where they are, and having <em>lots</em> of hands-on activities.
