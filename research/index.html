								<h1><strong>Research Overview</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>
								My primary projects explore how people use their knowledge of the statistics of their language to guide online processing. I'm also interested in how people learn the statistics of their environment in the first place.
							</p>
							<p><h2><strong>Uncertainty Maintenance in Speech Perception</p></h2></strong>
							<p>
								When we're processing speech, it isn't the case that the only information about a phoneme is contained in the time that sound is produced in the speech stream. By contrast, there are a multitude of cues smeared all across the speech stream that can give clues as to what the phoneme in question was -- there's coarticulation before and after the sound, there are semantic cues in the words around it, etc. Consider a sentence like "When the ?ent in the fender was noticed, we sold the car". Acoustic cues will give information about what the "?" sound was supposed to be, but later semantic context ("fender" is more likely to go with "dent") <em>also</em> gives a crucial cue to the sound.
							</p>
							<p>
								In an ongoing series of experiments, I'm investigating to what extent listeners <em>maintain uncertainty</em> about a sound after they've already heard it. That is, do they immediately categorize after the sound is heard and then toss all of the uncertainty in the acoustic information? Or do they hold onto that uncertainty, and integrate it with other cues that appear in the speech stream? To this end, we use sentences like the example above
							</p>
							<p><h2><strong>Causal Attribution & Clustering in Statistical Learning</p></h2></strong>
							<p>
								In new joint work with Sam Cheyette and Gwyneth Heuser, we're starting to explore these questions.
							</p>
							<p><h2><strong>Multiword Expression Processing</p></h2></strong>
							<p>
								Can multiword phrases be processed as if they were a single word -- i.e., treated as one unit? For some phrases, like idioms, we know this must be the case. You can't really process "kick the bucket" <em>only</em> by composing the individual words together; to some extent you have to treat the phrase as one unit. But what about phrases that <em>do</em> have a compositional meaning, like "salt and pepper"?
